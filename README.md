**<p align=center>1.Pacman Pathfinding:Implementing Search Algorithms and Heuristics in Python**

<br>                                    
This project involves implementing various search algorithms in Python. The "search.py" module focuses on breadth-first search (BFS), uniform-cost search (UCS), and A* search algorithms. It explores the nodes in a search tree systematically, expanding nodes based on their cost. The "searchAgents.py" module defines functions like "getSuccessors," which returns triples of successors, actions, and step costs for a given state. Additionally, it features heuristics such as "CornersHeuristic" and "FoodHeuristic," optimizing Pacman's movement to explore corners and consume food efficiently in the game environment. The provided Python scripts offer a comprehensive exploration of pathfinding strategies and heuristics for the Pacman game.

**<p align=center>2.Pacman Reflex and Adversarial Agents:Strategic Decision-Making in a Grid-based Environment**

<br>
This project involves implementing Pacman agents using reflex and adversarial search strategies. The Reflex Agent makes decisions based on a reflexive evaluation function considering Pacman's position, ghost positions, and food distances. Adversarial Search Agents, including Minimax, AlphaBeta, and Expectimax, strategically decide Pacman's actions. An improved evaluation function, betterEvaluationFunction, is introduced for adversarial agents. The Pacman game section provides an interface and logic for running the game, with various command-line options for customization.
